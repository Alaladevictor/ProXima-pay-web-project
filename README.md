# ProXima-pay-web-project 🏦

Project - a website for a digital bank! Built this to learn more about Frontend web development

## What I used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AOS library for scroll animations

## Features I Built
- Home page with cool animations
- Navigation that changes when you scroll
- Mobile menu that actually works
- Different pages like About and Contact
- Forms (still need to make them work with backend)
- Cool hover effects on the cards
- Everything works on mobile too!

## How to run it
1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digibank.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

That's it! No need to install anything else 😊

## Project folders
```
ProXimaPay/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
└── images/
```

## Things I learned
- How to make websites responsive
- How to use CSS variables
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- How to work with external libraries
- Git basics
- How important commenting code is!

## Things I want to add
- [ ] Make the forms actually work
- [ ] Add more animations
- [ ] Fix the mobile menu bug
- [ ] Add dark mode maybe?
- [ ] Make the code cleaner

## Problems I faced
- The mobile menu was really tricky to get right
- Had some issues with images not loading
- CSS can be really frustrating sometimes 😅
- Scroll animations were breaking on mobile

## Credits

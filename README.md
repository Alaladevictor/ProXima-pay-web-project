- AOS library for scroll animations

## Features I Built
- Home page with cool animations
- Navigation that changes when you scroll
- Mobile menu that actually works
- Different pages like About and Contact
- Forms (still need to make them work with backend)
- Cool hover effects on the cards
- Everything works on mobile too

## How to run it
1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProXimaPay.git
```



## Things I learned

- How important commenting code is!

## Things I want to add
- [ ] Make the forms actually work

- Scroll animations were breaking on mobile
